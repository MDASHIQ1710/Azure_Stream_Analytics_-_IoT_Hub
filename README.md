# Real-Time Streaming Data Project

## Overview
This project implements a real-time data streaming solution using Azure IoT Hub and Azure Stream Analytics. The system ingests data from a Raspberry Pi simulated environment and processes it to provide actionable insights, with results stored in Azure Blob Storage.

*Description: An overview of the system architecture including Azure IoT Hub, Azure Stream Analytics, and Blob Storage.*

## Technologies Used
- **Azure IoT Hub:** For device communication and data ingestion.
- **Azure Stream Analytics:** For real-time data processing and analytics.
- **Azure Blob Storage:** For storing processed results.
- **Raspberry Pi Azure IoT Online Simulator:** Used to simulate data input.

## Project Setup
### Prerequisites
- An Azure account with permissions to create resources.
- Azure IoT Hub, Stream Analytics, and Blob Storage services configured.

### Steps to Run the Project
1. **Set Up Azure IoT Hub**
   - Create an Azure IoT Hub in the Azure Portal.
   - Register a new device (e.g., Raspberry Pi simulator).

3. **Configure Azure Stream Analytics Job**
   - Create a new Stream Analytics job in the Azure Portal.
   - Set the IoT Hub as the input source.
   - Define the output to be Azure Blob Storage.
